# tracePtLas

tracePtLas is 2 smalls programs, tracePtLas2D (z=0) and tracePtLas3D, in Python 3.11 which traces in Autocad the points of the .las files.

When you receive a large amount of point clouds from a Lidar, being able to batch process .las files is a must.

The clouds containing less than 1000 points are ignored.

Insert a block containing points.

Save each drawing under the name of the .las.

Point resolution is reduced. 1/12 for 3D, 1/32 for 2D
 
## Installation
